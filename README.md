# JS Bear Game

This Javascript Bear Game is a simple game in which the player must traverse the map and avoid the bear, progressing through the game.

I originally made a bash version, then later a PHP version when learning these languages and have decided to re-do it in JS, this time with some tweaks.

## Playing the game
You can either clone the repo and open game.html in your browser of choice, or you can visit this [GitHub link](https://adamhebby.github.io/JSBearGame/game.html).

## Javascript
If you would like to take a look at the Javascript, the main game is located in `game.js`.
